Hello! This is the read me tutorial on how to use my program! 
I have set up the file in a java doc for the user to open in another IDE or in their systems console. 
Once you have that set up, the game plays as a text based escape room! 
Solve the puzzles, use the hints, and then you have can escape the room!
Once you solve the room, the game now gives you an updated feature! 
There is a new elevator after you exit the door, and you have the choice of going up and leaving, or going down to investigate further.
If you choose to go down, that is where the new DLC for my program begins!
The console will give you choices to make using numbers on how to procede, so enter the numbers in the console chat and the game will continue!
Good luck and have fun!
